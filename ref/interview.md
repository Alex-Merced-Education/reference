# Preparing For Software Developer Technical Interviews

In this document you'll find a collection of resources and advice to help preparing for different aspects of a technical interview.

## Improving Your Computer Science Knowledge

You don't need to be a computer science genius but there are somethings to get familiar with to truly "talk the talk". You can learn a lot of this from my computer science playlist below.

[COMPUTER SCIENCE VIDEO PLAYLIST](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLY6oTPmKnKbbfwjU1ToZlUWCinxmFqlIp)

Topics to make sure you understand:
- What is TCP/IP? (how computers talk to each other, IP addresses being how they identify each other)
- What is HTTP? (the standard protocol for web requests, the format which the server and client write their messages to each other)
- What is HTML/CSS/JS? (what are their respective roles in a website)
- What is the difference between frontend javascript in the browser vs backend javascript with node/deno/bun?
- What is the stack and the heap
- What is CRUD
- What is REST
- Synchronous vs Asynchronous
- The role of data types
- What are design patterns and familiarity with the big three categories of them
- What is the difference between functional programming and object oriented programming
- What are algorithms and a high level understanding of different sorting and search algorithms?

Bottom line, you should be able to talk intelligably about the above. Again, you don't need to be an expert but you should be able to have a thoughtful conversation about the above.

- Also highly recommend Watching all the [100 Seconds of Code Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC471a9qrU4&list=PL0vfts4VzfNiI1BsIK5u7LpPaIDKMJIDN)

## Technical Questions

There are several great repositories with practice interview questions. The approach should be look at the questions and if you don't feel confident that you know the answer spend some time researching the question. If you reserve a handful of questions each day in a few weeks you'll learn more than you ever imagined.

- [Frontend Dev Interview Questions](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions)
- [ReactJS Interview Questions](https://github.com/sudheerj/reactjs-interview-questions)
- [Javascript Interview Questions](https://github.com/ganqqwerty/123-Essential-JavaScript-Interview-Questions)
- [More Javascript Interview Questions](https://github.com/sudheerj/javascript-interview-questions)
- [Backend Developer Interview Questions](https://github.com/arialdomartini/Back-End-Developer-Interview-Questions)
- [Full Stack Developer Interview Questions](https://github.com/indy256/Full-stack-Developer-Interview-Questions-and-Answers)

Along with the above resources I highly recommend taking the tests at [triplebyte.com](https://triplebyte.com/engineers)

- When doing a quiz on triplebyte, if you don't know the answer or a particular term, write down a note to research further later for if you take the test again later.
- If you score high enough on the exam you'll be put in the frontlines of companies using triplebyte to identify good candidates.

## Whiteboarding and Code Challenges

In the computer science playlist I shared earlier in many of the data structure video I explain those concepts by whiteboarding. I highly recommend watching those videos on seeing how to write and talk about things at a high-level which is the purpose of a whiteboarding exercise.

- It's not about the exact code you'd write but the logical thought process of what the solution should look like that transcends language, being able to articulate a clear vision of the path you may try to take with plausible reasons as to why it may work.

When it comes to code challenges this is where doing a lot of online code challenges will really be helpful. Great websites for doing these challenges are:

- [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [CodeSignal](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard)
- [l33tcode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [SqlZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/)
- [CoderByte](https://coderbyte.com/)
