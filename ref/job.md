# Developer Job Market Overview


## Applications vs Websites

- Website purpose is display content to promote something else, SEO matters:
  - Use a CMS like Wordpress, Joomla, Squarespace, Wix
  - Use a Static Site Generator like Gatsby (React), Eleventy (EJS+), Astro (React, Vue, Svelte)
  - Use a Headless CMS like Builder.io, Sanity.io, Contentful, Agility
  - Headless CMS (Backend) + Static Site Generator (Frontend) = JAMStack

- Applications are actual products users sign in to do things, SEO not as important, speed is:
  - Backends can be powered by custom backend in any langauge or even a headless CMS depending on use case
  - Frontend should use a frontend framework like React, Svelte, SolidJS, Angular, Vue and Qwik
  - Bundle backend and frontend with a meta framework (Next/Remix (React), SvelteKit (Svelte), Solid-Start (SolidJS), Analog (Angular), Nuxt (Vue), and Qwik City (Qwik))
  - If using templating to build application (EJS, ERB, Jinja) then use libraries like jQuery, Alpine, HTMX to handle frontend reactivity
